It is not true that $2^{n+1} = O(2^n)$, or that $2^{2n} = O(2^n)$, but it is true that $2^{n+1} = \Omega(2^n)$ and $2^{2n} = \Omega(2^n)$. This is because $O(f(n))$ establishes an asymptotic lower bound for $f(n)$. For the former provided equations to be true, there would need to exist some constant $c$ such that $2^{n+1} \leq c \cdot 2^n$. No such constant exists for asymptotically-relevant values of $n$.
