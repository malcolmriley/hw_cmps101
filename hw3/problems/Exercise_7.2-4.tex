For any given case of the problem of sorting almost-sorted input, \textsc{Insertion Sort} will tend to beat \textsc{Quicksort}. This is because the best-case runtime of \textsc{Insertion Sort} occurs when the input array is already sorted; for a sorted input array, \textsc{Insertion Sort} runs in $ \Theta(n) $ time. This is in stark contrast with \textsc{Quicksort}, whose worst-case occurs when the input array is already sorted; the runtime will be $ \Theta(n^2) $. As such, when the input is very nearly sorted, \textsc{Insertion Sort} will be operating very near to the ideal case, whereas \textsc{Quicksort} will be operating very near to the worst-case.
