If it is given that the splits at every level of \textsc{Quicksort} are between $ \alpha $ and $ 1 - \alpha $ for some value of $ \alpha \mid 0 < \alpha \leq \frac{1}{2} $, then the minimum depth leaf of the recursion tree will terminate as a result of continuously ``choosing'' the $ \alpha $ split, whereas the maximum depth leaf of the recursion tree will terminate as a result of continuously ``choosing'' the $ 1 - \alpha $ split. This is because $ 1 - \alpha \geq \alpha $, since $ 0 < \alpha \leq \frac{1}{2} $. This minimum depth leaf will have a depth of $ x $ steps where $ 1 \approx \alpha^x $, and the max will be given by $ 1 \approx (1 - \alpha)^x $. These equations may be rearranged to receive $ x \approx \log_{\alpha}(\frac{1}{x}) $ and $ x \approx \log_{1 - \alpha}(\frac{1}{x}) $, respectively. Using the change-of-base formula for logarithms, the desired result of $ -\lg(n) \div \lg(\alpha) $ and $ -\lg(n) \div \lg(1 - \alpha) $ is obtained.
