For an array $ A $ of $ n $ distinct elements in reverse sorted order, the element selected for the pivot will be the last element in the array, therefore the smallest element of the array. Thus, the partition step will require $ n $ steps. The remaining \textsc{Quicksort} subroutines constitute a recurrence of $ T(n) = T(n - 1) $. The sum runtime of the algorithm will be a recurrence given by $ T(n) = T(n-1) + \Theta(n) $, which is known to be $ \Theta(n^2) $ as determined in \textbf{7.2-1}.
