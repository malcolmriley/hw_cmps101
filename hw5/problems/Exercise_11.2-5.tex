If $ n $ keys are stored into a hash table of size $ m $, and if these keys are drawn from a universe $ U $ where $ \mid U \mid > nm $, then there exists a subset of keys in $ U $ containing at least $ n $ elements - since $ U $ is greater than the product of $ m $ and $ n $. This subset must contain $ n $ elements that will hash to the same value $ m $. For a table that resolves collisions with chaining, these keys would be stored in a list of length $ n $. Thus, the worst-case search time for a chained hash is $ \Theta(n) $, the time it would take to fully-traverse a list of length $ n $.
