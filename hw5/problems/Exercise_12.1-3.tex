The following program will perform an in-order traversal of a binary search tree. The subprogram \textsc{Visit} is an alias for whatever visitation logic needs to be executed per node of this tree walk. It is assumed that the stack has the conventional stack-related methods, particularly \textsc{push} and \textsc{pop}.
