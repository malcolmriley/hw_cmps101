By the definition of simple uniform hashing, for a hash function $ h $ using a finite number $ n $ distinct keys into an array with finite length $ m $, each index $ m $ is equally likely to be returned by $ h $ for a given value of $ n $. In other words, for any value $ n_i $, the likelihood that $ h(n_i) = m_i $ is $ \frac{1}{m} $. A collision for two keys $ n_1 $ and $ n_2 $ means that $ h(n_1) = h(n_2) $.
