The tree will be identical to diagram 13.1, with a new node of key $ 36 $ inserted as the right child of the node with value $ 35 $. If this newly-inserted node is red, the resulting tree will not be a red-black tree as property 4 will be violated for the node with value $ 35 $: ``If a node is red, then both its children are black.'' If the newly-inserted node is black, all required red-black tree properties will be satisfied.
