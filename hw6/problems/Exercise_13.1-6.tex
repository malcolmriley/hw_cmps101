By definition, the black height $ k $ of a red-black tree is the black-height of the root. Thus, for any leaf of the indicated red-black tree, there is at most $ k $ black nodes between the root and the requisite leaf. The longest possible path with a black-height $ k $ will consist of $ 2k $ nodes, half red and half black, as demonstrated in $ 13.1-5 $, and the shortest possible path with a black-height of $ k $ will consist of $ k $ nodes, all black. For a red-black tree with black-height $ k $, this means that the largest number of internal nodes the tree may contain will be that of a complete binary tree of height $ 2k $; the quantity of nodes in this tree will be $ 2^{2k+1} - 1 $. The smallest number of nodes this tree may contain will be that of a non-complete binary tree consisting of all black nodes, $ 2k + 1 $, as that is the smallest number of nodes for a binary tree of height $ k $.
