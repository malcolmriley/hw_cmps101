Changing the backend representation of a graph object $ G $ from an adjacency-list to an adjacency-matrix only affects the portion of the algorithm that tests for adjacency; this is to say, line 12 from Figure 22.3: $ \textsc{BFS}(G,s) $. To compute the values $ v \in G.Adj[u] $, it becomes necessary to scan the entire row of the matrix corresponding to $ u $. This is, in almost all circumstances, worse than scanning the adjacency-list corresponding to $ u $ as such a list will only contain as many entries as there are outward edges from $ u $. The runtime thus shifts from $ O( \mid V \mid + \mid E \mid) $ to $ O( \mid V \mid^2) $.
