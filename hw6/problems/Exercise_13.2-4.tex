Setting inserted node $ z $ to red preserves the quantity of black nodes that are descended from the parents of $ z $. If $ z $ were changed to black instead of red, then it would change the number of black nodes descended from the parent of $ z $ to any potential children of $ z $ - given that no other nodes are changed during this operation, this would violate property 5 of red-black trees: that for any node, all simple paths from the node to a descendent leaf contain the same number of black nodes.
