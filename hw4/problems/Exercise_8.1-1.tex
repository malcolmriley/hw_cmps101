The smallest possible depth of a leaf in a decision tree for a comparison sort is 1. Consider the case of an array of exactly two elements. Any comparison-based algorithm implemented to sort this array will need to make exactly one comparison, regardless of final ordering of this array. Thus, the leaves of the decision tree for this algorithm will both have a depth of one.

An array containing exactly two elements is the smallest array for which a comparison sort is implementable; for an array containing fewer than two elements, the elements cannot be compared against each-other.
