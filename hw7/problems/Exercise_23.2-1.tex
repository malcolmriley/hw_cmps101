If $ T $ is a minimum spanning tree of $ G $, then Kruskal's algorithm is capable of returning $ T $ if there exists some method of imposing an ordering on the edges of $ G $ such that the edges of $ T $ are preferentially favored over edges of another minimum spanning tree of $ G $. This may be an auxiliary property of the involved vertices (such as alphabetical order, in the case of alphabetically-named vertices) - however the edges of $ T $ must be known beforehand.
