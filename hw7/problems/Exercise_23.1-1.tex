As established in section 23.1, the construction of a minimum spanning tree of some graph $ G $ consists of discovering all ``safe'' edges of $ G $; any minimum spanning tree of $ G $ will effectively be a list of such ``safe'' edges. If  $ (u,v) $ is a minimum-weight edge of $ G $, then for any arbitrary cut of $ G $ such that the cut is crossed by $ (u,v) $, then $ (u,v) $ is also a ``light edge'' for that cut. Thus, $ (u,v) $ will be a ``safe edge'' for construction of a minimum spanning tree of $ G $.
