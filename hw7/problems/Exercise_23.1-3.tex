This is the converse of the tenet established in Exercise 23.1-1. Suppose that edge $ (u,v) $ is in some minimum spanning tree of $ G $, but suppose that it is \textit{not} a light edge crossing an arbitrary cut of $ G $ such that this cut constructs the minimum spanning tree of $ G $. If $ (u,v) $ is not a light edge, then there would exist some other edge that had a lower weight than it - implying that $ (u,v) $ is not ``safe'' for $ G $, meaning that it would not belong to this minimum spanning tree of $ G $. This is a contradiction; hence if $ (u,v) $ is in a minimum spanning tree of $ G $, then it is also a light edge crossing some cut of $ G $.
